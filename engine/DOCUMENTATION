Universe deals mostly with binding various star systems together, and keeping graphics on track.
Star System deals with the current cameras, and the current lights, and keeping order when the scene may be changed (swithcing to a cam in a different star system for instance).


Units are accessed through a UnitContainer or a UnitCollection depending on the number.  These structures keep reference counts and remove any "dead" units from them when accessed. Star system has the complete list of units and cycles through them to accomplish physics, etc.
